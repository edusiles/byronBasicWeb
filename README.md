## About

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a repository that contains the basic web development content presented in the basic technical training of the <b>byron.solutions</b> trainee process.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this training I trained in <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> technologies covering basic issues such as web fundamentals, semantics, accessibility, basic CSS and flexbox.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I also delved deeper into <b>Git</b> and <b>Github</b> topics, such as <i>Gitflow</i> and collaborative activities that can be viewed in <a src="https://github.com/tomlavez/byronTrainee">this</a> repository.</p>
